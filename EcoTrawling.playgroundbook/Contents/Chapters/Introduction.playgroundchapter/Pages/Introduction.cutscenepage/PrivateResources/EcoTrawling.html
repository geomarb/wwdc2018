		<div>Hello!

My name is Geomar, and...

…once upom at time when I was younger I joinned to an 
organization called Sea Shepherd which used to have some
projects to help to protect the sea. One of the projects that I
was part was the "Ecologic Trawling". In groups of 10 to 20
persons we went to some beaches to clean it together, 
collecting a lot of garbage left by the beach.

This Playground Book was created based on this real project,
to help raising conscience about this topic... 

…but why should you care about keep the beach clean???
